beat
====

beat is a tool for creating and applying patches
in the BPS file format.

Compared to tools like `diff` and `patch`,
beat provides much better support for binary files.

Compared to tools that use the IPS patch file format,
beat produces much smaller patches and supports much larger files.

Compared to tools like `bsdiff` and `xdelta3`,
beat uses a much simpler file format
you can implement yourself without a bulky library dependency.
